The project idea we chose is Music Finer Website, this website allows users to publish and look up for upcoming concerts around the world. 

The database we use is on MongoDB, and we allow users to Create, Read, Update and Delete from our list.

User authentication is not enabled at this stage, but will be added on the upcoming part of the project. 

The project repository has 3 main folders; node_modules folder with all the modules installed on the projects, Server folder with files accessible only on the server end and Public folder with files accessible to the front end. 

The package.json file has listed all the dependencies used on this project.
